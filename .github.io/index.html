      <h2>About Plasticure</h2>
      <p>
        Plasticure is a cutting-edge environmental effort to end ocean plastic pollution using innovative technology. Our robotic system detects and harvests plastic waste without harming marine ecosystems. Then, we accelerate safe biodegradation through the use of the plastic-eating microbe <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through robotics, microbiology, and environmental stewardship, Plasticure offers a practical mass solution to one of humanity’s most pressing environmental concerns—clean oceans and the preservation of marine ecosystems for future generations.

      <h2>Our Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Our advanced robotics use smart sensors and AI-powered navigation to identify ocean plastics precisely and safely. Once collected, the microbe <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em> accelerates biodegradation, breaking down plastics into harmless components quickly and naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        This combined approach allows Plasticure to address the plastic pollution problem at scale without disrupting aquatic life.
